That the aforesaid Rea and Aaron Chambers communicate living together as man and wife on or about 18th day of April AD 1857, and continued to live together as such until the decease of aforesaid Aaron, according to custom of persons of color in the state of Kentucky.\n\nThat we have often heard said Aaron Chambers call his (Rea) Chambers, wife, and always treated and respected her in such relation. That they were considered as man and wife by all their neighbors and acquaintances, and considered respectable in the community in which they lived.\n\nThat there are now living men of their said Aaron and Rea Chambers under the age of sixteen years. And that she has been a widow since the death of above named soldier (Aaron Chambers) dec'd.\n\nThat we have 30 acres in the Valley\n\nH. C. Hinkle, Jr.\nW. D.
